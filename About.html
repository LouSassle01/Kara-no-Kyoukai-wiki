          <h2> About this page </h2>

            <p>This is a Fandom inspired website for 空の境界: Garden of Sinners that I created for ITEC 50, and to also remake a similar website that we created two years ago I think? Yeah.</p>

          <h2> About the creator of this page </h2>

          <h2> As for this series itself would I recommend it or not? </h2>
            <p> Of course it is a must watch, specially if you love shows like these that have thriller, mystery and fantasy themes to them. Kara no Kyoukai has definitely got me on the edge of my seat from it's spectacular visuals specially at the of its release, the thrilling story that keeps you engaged all the time whilst also making the viewer piece together the mystery behind Mifune City's biggest mysteries, for me this is definitely Kinoko Nasu's magnum opus. </p>
