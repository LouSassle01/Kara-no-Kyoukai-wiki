            <h2> Kara no Kyoukai </h2>
            
            <p><i>Kara no Kyoukai</i> (空の境界, Kara no Kyōkai?, lit. "Boundary of Emptiness") is one of TYPE-MOON's earliest works, authored by Kinoko Nasu and illustrated by Takashi Takeuchi. It is abbreviated by fans as Rakkyo (らっきょ?), and is officially translated as The Garden of Sinners. Originally published as a web novel in 1998, the series was republished in novel form in 2004, and then adapted into eight animated movies by Ufotable from 2007 to 2013.</p>

            <h2> Story </h2>

            <h3> Setting </h3>
        The events in Kara no Kyoukai take place in Mifune City in the 1990s. Notable locations include Garan no Dou, an agency run by Touko that engages in cases with supernatural or abnormal elements, and Reien Girl's Academy.

        It also introduces some of the most fundamental concepts in the universe of Type-Moon's works, including souls, the Root, Counter Force, Magic and Magecraft, and Origin.<br>

        <h3> Plot </h3>

        Mikiya Kokutou becomes intrigued by the mysterious series of violent deaths occurring in his town and Shiki Ryougi, a beautiful but unsociable girl. As he tries to become closer to Shiki, he realizes that Shiki is connected to the mysterious deaths and that the supernatural forces involved with both could kill him. It is revealed that in Shiki's family, certain members of her family possess two distinct personalities, both aware and conscious of one another, but possessing different qualities. The dual consciousness, and Shiki's upbringing as a demon hunter, has caused her to reject other human beings. <br>
                        <br>
        However, upon meeting Mikiya, she gradually finds happiness through their relationship and a schism develops between her two personalities. As a result, she winds up in a traffic accident and is left in a coma for two years. When she awakens, she finds herself unable to connect her past memories to her current identity. Reunited with Mikiya, now employed as an investigator for Touko Aozaki, Shiki assists Touko's detective agency, Garan no Dou, whenever combat is required, while struggling to come to terms with her identity.</p>

            <h2> Characters </h2>

            <h3> Shiki Ryougi </h3>
        A woman who possesses the "Mystic Eyes of Death Perception", a supernatural ability that allows the user to see and directly realize the "death" of everything in existence. She recently recovered from a two-year coma caused by a traffic accident. Prior to the traffic accident, she originally had two personalities, a male personality named SHIKI (織?), and the original female personality Shiki (式?). Children born into the Ryougi family are generally male and are raised with two personalities, and the male personality is customarily called the "yang" personality, while the female is called the "yin" personality. It is easy to tell which Shiki is speaking at a given time because they both have a distinct style of speaking, most notably that the female Shiki refers to herself with the pronoun watashi (私?), while male Shiki refers to himself as ore (オレ?). After waking from her coma, Shiki discovers that she can no longer feel the male Shiki's presence and assumes that he died because of the accident. She also feels a detachment from her memories before the accident, and while she knows she is Shiki, she does not feel that she is. In the hopes of regaining herself and the "dead" Shiki, she puts on a cold façade that somewhat resembles the male Shiki's and tries to act as the female Shiki did. Touko understands the sense of detachment Shiki feels, but considers the current Shiki a third, new personality.<br>

        <h3> Mikiya Kokutou </h3>
        Shiki's friend who, two years ago, made a promise with Shiki to attend college together. He discovers a puppet at an exhibition his friend asked him to attend and is entranced by the hollowness of the puppets that resembled Shiki. He is so charmed by it that he seeks out the maker, Touko, and then finds her workplace. With his hopes of attending college with Shiki crushed because of her coma, he drops out of college to work under Touko as an assistant. Touko holds his investigative skills with high regard because of his ability to find her workplace, an abandoned building hidden by a Bounded Field. The male Shiki and the current Shiki call him Cocteau (コクトー, Kokutō?) due to his last name's resemblance to Jean Cocteau's last name. <br>

        <h3> Azaka Kokutou </h3>
        Mikiya's younger sister, who loves him in a romantic way. She becomes an apprentice of Touko due to her rivalry with Shiki, and is talented in the magic of ignition. She is quite similar both in appearance and abilities to Tohno Akiha (though Akiha's ability consists of controlling external heat, whereas Azaka's ability is inducing ignition).

        <h3> Touko Aozaki </h3>
        Appearing as a puppet maker, Touko is actually an extremely powerful magus. She runs a business in an abandoned building called Garan no Dou, a detective agency consisting of only herself and Mikiya that only takes supernatural or otherwise abnormal cases. She is the sister of Tsukihime's Aoko Aozaki, with whom she does not share a particularly good relationship.<br> </p>
